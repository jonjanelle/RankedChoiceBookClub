# RankedChoiceBookClub
BookClub was originally designed to help a small book club in the Boston, MA area coordinate meetings. Each club is assigned a unique code with which members can join a group.

Each book club can have one or more administrators. Administrators are responsible for setting the date, time, location, book nomination deadline, and book selection deadline for each meeting. Prior to the book nomination deadline, members may nominate books that will be voted on by members. Between the nomination and selection deadlines, each member may choose their first, second, and third choice books in a ranked-choice voting system.

A book must win more than 50% of votes to be declared the winner. If no winner is immediately present, then the ranked-choice assignment rules used in the Maine state election go into effect until a winner is found.

Members are generally expected to bring snacks or drinks to meetings, so a simple contribution organizer is included to prevent refreshment duplication.

Prior to deadlines and meetings, automated reminders are sent to members.
